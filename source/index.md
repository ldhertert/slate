# Introduction

Welcome to the NFHS Network Client Application API Documentation.  This information is an attempt to document the API's necessary to render public facing clients (nfhsnetwork.com, mobile apps, etc).  

This documentation is a work in progress.  If you see anything that is missing, feel free to ask or to create a pull request after you've figured it out yourself.
